  info: An SDK takes a signed request and handles the technical details of turning
    it into a proper API call to the server. When the server replies, the raw response
    is usually just structured data (like JSON, XML). Through response parsing, the
    SDK converts that raw data into clear, usable objects, such as a user profile
    or other information your app can work with directly.
