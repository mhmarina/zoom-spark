  info: "Authenticated keys are the root credentials that establish trust between
    a client and a server. From these, the server can generate JWT tokens, which
    act like time-limited passes proving the client\u2019s identity. When the client
    makes an API call, it sends a signed request that includes the JWT (or a signature
    derived from the key), allowing the server to verify both who is calling and
    that the request hasn\u2019t been tampered with. "
